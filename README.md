# LSTMChar2Char
Tensorflow implementation of Char 2 Char LSTM based on several examples. This is an experimental repository where I am trying out different ideas on this simple LSTM problem. 

Stuff I am trying
1) Embeddings
2) Mutiple depth LSTMS
3) Batch Normalization
4) Visualization of LSTMs
5) Variants of LSTMs based on "LSTM: Search Odessey" paper
6) Memory
7) Attention based
